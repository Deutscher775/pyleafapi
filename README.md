# PyLeafAPI
A custom Nanoleaf API for extended use or custom controller apps ([App example](https://github.com/Deutscher775/PyLeaf)).

# Setup
1. Set your IP and Token in `nanoleaf-config.py`
2. Create an `API Start Animation` animation in your Nanoleaf Scenes (optional, remove in line `95` if not used)
3. Run `nanoleaf-service.py`
4. Have fun!

# Note
The `panel-layout.png` file does not exist here. I've removed it for security and clarity.
To control stand-alone panels, you need to build a layout yourself, by getting the ID of each individual panel.

Also the `nanaleaf-service.py` is in a sperate folder!
